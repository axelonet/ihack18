# ihack 18

ihack is a online cryptic hunt conducted for 24 hours by UPES-CSI. Participation will be done individually. Participants would have to search for clues spread over the webpages to pass through the various levels and score points accordingly.

The clues maybe hidden in the HTML source code or encrypted into a song or a picture. The person who clears most levels by the end of the 24-hour mark would be declared as a winner.

Bonus points would be awarded to participants if they can come up with an idea for a level. This bonus is only available after clearing the first stage.

As the event is online, participants will be provided with their unique id and passwords through email and their scores will be regularly updated with their id. Participants need to provide their valid email address so that the id and passwords can be easily availed to them.
